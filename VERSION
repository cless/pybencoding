THIS VERSION: 20110517

2011-05-17  - Created github repository, older changes will not be under
              version control
            - Added example code

2011-04-24  - Changed date format to YYYY-MM-DD for versioning, bigger
              integer denotes a newer version
            - Fixed a bug that would treat False as an integral type but
              encode it using the 'False' string, attempting to encode a
              boolean now results in an error
            - Fixed a bug where an integer value of 0 in a list or
              dictionary resulted in a parse error while decoding

2011-04-03  - Original release
